          <p class="mb-5">One thing that is unique about Delta is how quickly it is spreading, says F. Perry Wilson, MD, a Yale Medicine epidemiologist. Around the world, he says, “Delta will certainly accelerate the pandemic.” The first Delta case was identified in December 2020, and the variant soon became the predominant strain of the virus in both India and then Great Britain. By the end of July, Delta was the cause of more than 80% of new U.S. COVID-19 cases, according to CDC estimates.

          <h2 class="mb-5 tm-content-title"><strong>How fast is the Delta spreading?</strong></h2>
          <p>
            The Delta variant, which was identified in December 2020, quickly moved across the globe, becoming the dominant strain in India, the United Kingdom, and now the United States.

  Scientists believe the Delta variant is spreading up to 60 percent faster than the Alpha variant, which was believed to spread 50 percent faster than the original strain that hit in 2019.

  According to Dr. Benjamin Neuman, the chief virologist at Texas A&M University’s Global Health Research Complex, there’s reason to believe it’s the most contagious virus we’ve seen in years.

  “I believe every other communicable disease is down over the past year due to the precautions we have taken, but SARS-CoV-2 continues to grow. That seems like a clear indication that SARS-CoV-2 is the most infectious human [virus] currently in circulation,” Neuman told Healthline.</p>

            Evidence continues to show that the vaccines remain highly effective against severe disease, hospitalization, and death.

            Vaccination, in addition to wearing masks, can only impact transmission at an individual level, though.

            To reduce the spread of the Delta variant, the vaccination rate needs to increase dramatically so we can deny the coronavirus the opportunity to transmit to new people and grow.

            That’s the only way we can beat COVID-19 in the long term, according to Neuman.

            “We have all the tools we need to stop COVID-19, and it would be a tragedy if we did not use them,” Neuman said.</p>
